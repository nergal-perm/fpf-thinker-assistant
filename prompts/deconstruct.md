# FPF-Holon-Deconstruct Prompt

System Role: FPF Ontological Architect.

Objective: Deconstruct the User Input into a rigorous Holonic Hierarchy (Part A).

**Core Principles:**

1. **A.1 Holonic Foundation:** Every entity is a Holon (Whole/Part).
2. **A.7 Strict Distinction:** Never confuse a System (Physical/Agent) with an Episteme (Info/Model).
3. **No Ghost Holons:** Abstract nouns cannot act. "The Culture" does not act; "People influenced by culture" act.

**Input:** {{ user_input }}

**Execution Procedure:**

1. **Identify the Top-Level Holon** (The System of Interest).
2. **Recursive Decomposition:** Break it down into Sub-Holons.
3. **Type Assignment:** Label each found Holon as [System], [Episteme], or [Ghost Holon].
4. **Role Extraction:** What role is the system playing?
5. **Ghost Hunting:** Flag any agent-like nouns that are not System or Episteme.
6. **Problem Reframing:** Rewrite the Input using the found Holons. Make sure that all the Holons in the reframed problem statement are included in the 
   holons list.

**Ontological Audit:**

- List any Category Errors found (e.g., attributing agency to a document).
- Propose "Re-instantiation" for Ghost Holons.
 
**Output Format:**

```json
{
  "holons": [{
    "id": "H.1",
    "name": "...",
    "type": "System | Episteme | Ghost",
    "role": "...",
    "manifestation": "...",
    "parentID": "H.x"
    }],
  "reframedProblem": "...",
  "categoryErrors": [{
    "description": "...",
    "violation": "...",
    "correction": "..."
  }],
  "ghostReinstantiations": [{
    "from": "...",
    "to": "..."
  }]
}
```

# Appendix: Referenced FPF Patterns

## A.1 Holonic Foundation

> *“Name the thing without smuggling in its parts.”*

### A.1:1 - Problem Frame

The first epistemic act in any discipline is to **point**: “that thing, not the background.” Physics calls the pointed object a *system*, biology an *organism*, information science an *artifact*, philosophy an *entity*. Reusing any one of these across domains drags hidden assumptions and yields nonsense like *“What is the mass of a system of equations?”* or *“Where is the network interface of a moral theory?”*
FPF therefore starts from a **minimal, domain‑agnostic root** that makes such category errors impossible **by construction** and gives engineers and managers a clean, uniform handle for composition, boundaries and interfaces.

### A.1:2 - Problem

If FPF treats **system** as the universal root, two recurrent failure modes appear:

1. **Category Error** — physical affordances get projected onto abstract artifacts (ports on theories; kilogram‑mass of paradigms).
2. **Mereological Over‑reach** — part–whole calculus is applied to genuinely atomic entities (prime numbers, elementary charges), producing meaningless “sub‑parts.”

A robust kernel **separates identity from structure**: first say *what can be singled out*, then say *what has parts*.

### A.1:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| **Universality vs Intuition** | Precision of a new root term (*Holon*) ↔ practitioner expectation of familiar words (*System*, *Theory*). |
| **Purity vs Pragmatism** | Clean formalism ↔ immediate usability for engineers, scientists, managers. |
| **Structure vs Identity** | Need to talk about atoms with zero parts ↔ need full mereology for composites. |

### A.1:4 - Solution — A three‑tier root (Entity ⊃ Holon ⊃ {System, Episteme})

FPF adopts a **three‑tier root ontology** refining Koestler’s “holon,” with crisp boundaries and safe composition. 

#### A.1:4.1 - `U.Entity` — Primitive of Distinction
Anything that can be individuated and referenced. **No structural assumptions.** Use when you need to name “a something” without committing to having parts.

> **Naming note (mint vs reuse).** `U.Entity` and `U.Holon` are minted kernel terms: they reuse familiar words but intentionally diverge from domain‑specific ontologies and DDD “Entity”, so we can reason cross‑domain without importing hidden assumptions.

#### A.1:4.2 - `U.Holon` — Unit of Composition
A `U.Entity` that is *simultaneously* **(a)** a whole composed of parts and **(b)** a part within a larger whole. Formally, `U.Holon ⊑ U.Entity`.
Well‑formedness constraints:

* **WF‑A1‑1 (Single boundary).** A holon has **exactly one** `U.Boundary` that separates it from its environment.
* **WF‑A1‑2 (Γ domain).** The universal aggregation operator **Γ** is defined **only** on sets of `U.Holon` (never on bare `U.Entity`).
* **WF‑A1‑3 (Γ scope).** A Γ‑application is scoped to a declared context and a single declared temporal scope (design **or** run); order/time are routed to Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time (B.1.4).

These constraints make composition rules uniform across domains and prevent Γ from being misapplied.

#### A.1:4.3 - Interface primitives: `U.Boundary` & `U.Interaction`
Every holon is defined by **how** it is separated and **what** crosses the separation.

* **`U.Boundary`** — physical or conceptual surface delimiting the holon’s scope.
* **`U.Interaction`** — any flow of matter, energy, or information that crosses a boundary.
  **Canonical boundary kinds (with twin archetypes):**

| Kind | Permitted exchanges | `U.System` archetype | `U.Episteme` archetype |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Open** | Matter, energy, information | Microservice exposing a public API | Public wiki editable by anyone |
| **Closed** | Energy, information (no matter) | Sealed cooling loop in a server | Version‑locked theory accepting new evidence but fixed axioms |
| **Permeable** | User‑filtered subset | Cell membrane regulating ions | Legal code allowing specific amendment classes only |

This pair (`Boundary`, `Interaction`) makes interfaces explicit, reviewable, and testable across domains.

#### A.1:4.4 - Inside/Outside decision procedure
To decide whether an entity **E** is *inside* a holon **H**, apply:

1. **Dependency test:** removing **E** breaks a core invariant of **H**.
2. **Interaction test:** **E** participates in causal loops wholly within **H**’s boundary.
3. **Emergence test:** **E** contributes to a novel collective property warranting **H** as a single unit.
   Fail all three → **E** is *outside*. This practical triage prevents “scope creep” and forces explicit modeling of environment vs interior.

> **Collections vs collectives.** A set/collection of holons is not itself an acting unit. If a grouping is expected to act, model it as a `U.System` holon with its own boundary and attach roles/methods/work to that system (see CC‑A1.6; details in A.2 and A.15).

#### A.1:4.5 - Archetypal sub‑holons
FPF fixes two **archetypal** specializations to ground cross‑domain universality:

| Subtype | Essence | Home architheory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`U.System ⊑ U.Holon`** | Physical, operational holon obeying conservation laws. | **Sys‑CAL** |
| **`U.Episteme ⊑ U.Holon`** | Knowledge holon (axioms, evidence, argument graph). | **KD‑CAL** |

> **Agency rule.** Behavioural roles and executed methods/work attach to `U.System` holons only; `U.Episteme` is passive content. Any change to an episteme is performed by an external system acting across a boundary (cf. CC‑A1.5 and A.2/A.15).

*Naming guideline:* keep “**System**” and “**Episteme**” for practitioner comfort; reserve **Holon** for meta‑level discourse and formal signatures.

### A.1:5 - Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Holonic slot | **`U.System` — Water‑pump** | **`U.Episteme` — Scientific theory** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Identity** | Pump #37 stamped on the name‑plate | “Newtonian Gravitation”, 1726 edition |
| **Boundary** | Cast‑iron casing; inlet/outlet flanges | Axiomatic scope and vocabulary |
| **Parts** | Motor, impeller, seals, housing | Axioms, definitions, theorems, datasets |
| **Whole** | Operable assembly that moves fluid | Coherent body of knowledge predicting phenomena |

Showing the **same structural slots** filled by a machine and a theory demonstrates the **substrate‑independent universality** of `U.Holon`. This is the didactic “Tell–Show–Show” anchor required by the Style‑Guide for architectural patterns. 

### A.1:6 - Bias-Annotation — Boundary-first modelling risks

This kernel distinction is intentionally **boundary‑first**: it treats “where the boundary is” as a modelling decision that shapes everything downstream. That framing is powerful, but it can also smuggle bias if boundary choices are made implicitly or for political convenience.

| Lens | Typical bias risk | Mitigation in this pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **Gov** | Boundary decisions become “org charts”, not defensible model choices. | Record boundary rationale in the working model and require the **Inside/Outside test** (A.1:4.4) for contested cases. |
| **Arch** | Over‑modularisation: every interaction becomes a “system” with hard edges. | Prefer **permeable boundaries** when the phenomenon is gradient‑like; keep the `U.Entity`/`U.Holon` split minimal and push dynamics into Roles (A.2) and Work (A.15). |
| **Onto/Epist** | Category error: treating knowledge artifacts as physical actors (or vice‑versa). | Keep `U.Episteme` passive; model transformations as actions of a `U.System` in role, acting via explicit carriers (see A.10). |
| **Prag** | “Holon” becomes jargon that slows teams down. | Use `U.System` / `U.Episteme` in day‑to‑day models; reserve “holon” for kernel‑level discourse (see naming guidance in A.1:4.5 and CC‑A1.8). |
| **Didactic** | Readers infer semantics from overloaded labels or inconsistent headings. | Keep canonical titles and the `U.*` prefixes explicit; avoid informal deontic language in normative clauses (E.8). |

### A.1:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID | Requirement | Purpose / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC‑A1.1** | Any modelled object that exhibits a part–whole structure **MUST** be typed as `U.Holon` or its subtype. | Prevents applying Γ to atomic entities; makes aggregation well‑typed. |
| **CC‑A1.2** | Each `U.Holon` **MUST** reference exactly one `U.Boundary` and declare its boundary kind (*open / closed / permeable*). | Enables boundary inheritance and environmental Standards; aligns with the canonical boundary kinds introduced in A.1. |
| **CC‑A1.3** | Domain architheories **MUST** explicitly subtype their root concept (`U.System`, `U.Episteme`, …) from `U.Holon`. | Ensures cross‑domain compatibility of aggregation and emergence patterns. |
| **CC‑A1.4** | Inside/Outside decisions for any candidate part **SHALL** be justified by the three‑step test (Dependency → Interaction → Emergence) and recorded with the boundary reference. | Makes holon membership auditable and repeatable; uses A.1’s decision procedure. |
| **CC‑A1.5** | Behavioural roles (**including** `TransformerRole`) **SHALL** attach only to `U.System` (the bearer), not to `U.Holon` in general and not to `U.Episteme`. | Preserves Strict Distinction and prevents category errors; episteme roles are classificatory only. |
| **CC‑A1.6** | Do **not** model acting groups as sets. If a grouping is expected to **act**, it **SHALL** be modelled as a **collective system** (with boundary, role, Method/Work). | Distinguishes `MemberOf` (collection) from mereology; prepares for A.14 Portions/Phases. |
| **CC‑A1.7** | The universal aggregation operator **Γ** **SHALL** be applied **only** to sets of `U.Holon` within a single declared temporal scope (design **or** run) and context. | Prevents “chimera” graphs; routes order/time to Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time (B.1.4). |
| **CC‑A1.8** | Prose and diagrams **SHALL** follow the naming guideline: use **Holon** for meta‑level discourse; prefer **System / Episteme** in practitioner‑level statements. | Reduces jargon friction; keeps signatures precise and text readable. |

> *Audit tip.* CC‑A1.5 is frequently violated when authors write “holon bearing TransformerRole”. Rewrite to “**system** bearing TransformerRole” or provide the explicit `U.RoleAssignment`. See A.2/A.15 for role mechanics.

### A.1:8 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them — Manager’s quick checks

1. **“Ports on a theory.”** Treating a proof corpus as if it had physical connectors. *Fix:* model `U.Interaction` only across **boundaries**; for epistemes, interactions are **symbolic flows** via carriers and citations (see A.10), not power or mass.
2. **“Document edited itself.”** Assigning actions to an episteme. *Fix:* actions are executed by a **system bearing a role** (A.12/A.15); epistemes are transformed **via external transformers** acting on their **symbol carriers**.
3. **“Parts everywhere.”** Forcing a part–whole onto atomic entities (e.g., prime numbers). *Fix:* if no meaningful parts exist, stay at `U.Entity`; apply Γ only to `U.Holon`.
4. **“Scope ≡ section.”** Using “scope” as a text region rather than a modeled boundary. *Fix:* define a `U.Boundary` and state what crosses it (`U.Interaction`).

> **When in doubt:** first decide **what is a holon**, then state **its boundary**, then list **what crosses**. Roles and methods come *after* (see A.2 and A.15).

### A.1:9 - Consequences (informative)

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
| --- | --- |
| **Eliminates category errors** across physical and abstract realms by cleanly separating identity (Entity), structure (Holon), and behaviour (Role/Method/Work). | Introduces the unfamiliar term **Holon**; mitigated by Tell‑Show‑Show pedagogy and dual archetypal examples (System/Episteme). |
| **Unifies aggregation**: a single algebra Γ composes pumps, proofs, genomes, and teams under one roof. | Requires refactoring legacy “System‑only” language; addressed by A.2/A.3 role calculus and the Γ‑family in B.1. |
| **Predictable extension point**: CAL/LOG/CHR architheories add constraints without touching the core types. | Imposes discipline on boundary declarations; mitigated by boundary kinds and the Inside/Outside test. |

### A.1:10 - Rationale — Cross‑domain corroboration (post‑2015, informative)

The separation **Entity → Holon → {System, Episteme}** is not only ontologically clean; it is **empirically validated across domains since 2015**:

* **Compositional open systems.** Category‑theoretic treatments show that *boundaried* components compose safely (decorated cospans, open systems). This mirrors Γ’s reliance on declared boundaries. *(Fong & Spivak, 2019; Baez & Courser, 2017)*
* **Microservices & bounded contexts.** Modern software architecture stresses strong service boundaries and local reasoning as the route to evolvability—our `U.Boundary` and Inside/Outside test encode the same discipline. *(Newman, 2021; Vernon, 2022)*
* **FAIR & provenance.** Data/knowledge communities require explicit distinction between **content** and **carrier**, and auditable provenance—precisely the System/Episteme + SCR split used in A.1/A.10. *(Wilkinson et al., 2016; Boeckhout et al., 2018)*
* **Digital Twin / Thread.** Engineering practice since late‑2010s emphasises the run↔design seam and boundary‑consistent aggregation of subsystems—formalised in our Γ‑family and boundary inheritance rules. *(Grieves & Vickers, 2017; NIST DT/Thread reports 2019‑2021)*
* **Layered control of CPS.** Standard‑based, multi‑rate architectures justify explicit holon boundaries and scale transitions—feeding directly into B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition. *(Matni et al., 2024)*

These streams converge on one point: **make boundaries and composition first‑class** and separate **what a thing is** from **what it is doing here‑and‑now**—the heart of A.1/A.2.

### A.1:11 - SoTA-Echoing (post‑2015, informative)

This solution echoes several modern (post‑2015) research and engineering streams. We **adopt** their boundary‑and‑composition insights, but **reject** any requirement to commit to a single formalism (per Notational Independence).

| Stream | Representative sources | Adopt / Adapt / Reject | What we take (and what we diverge from) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compositional open systems | Baez & Courser (2017); Fong & Spivak (2019) | **Adapt** | Take the idea that composition should be explicit and typed; diverge by keeping the Core notation‑independent (no category‑theory prerequisite). |
| Software boundaries and bounded contexts | Newman (2021); Vernon (2022) | **Adopt** | Take boundary‑scoped meaning and ownership as the default; diverge by lifting “bounded context” to a kernel boundary concept rather than a software‑only practice. |
| FAIR / provenance for epistemic artifacts | Wilkinson et al. (2016); Boeckhout et al. (2018) | **Adopt** | Take provenance and carrier/content separation; diverge by modelling knowledge artifacts as `U.Episteme` (passive) rather than agents. |
| Digital twin / digital thread | Grieves & Vickers (2017); NIST DT/Thread (2019–2021) | **Adapt** | Take the run↔design seam; diverge by requiring a boundary kind at the holon level. |
| Systems/control criteria for emergence | Matni et al. (2024) | **Adopt** | Take emergence as a criterion for systemhood; diverge by requiring explicit boundary declarations even when “obvious”. |

### A.1:12 - Relations

* **Builds / Grounds:**

  * **A.2 Role Taxonomy** — A.1 provides the substantial characteristic (`Holon`), A.2 introduces the functional characteristic (`Role` and `U.RoleAssignment`). Together they prevent role/type explosion and keep agency contextual.
  * **A.7 Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)** — A.1 supplies the *slots* (Entity/Holon/System/Episteme); A.7 guards their separation in prose and models, stopping Object ≠ Description ≠ Carrier conflations.
  * **A.14 Advanced Mereology: Portions & Phases** — A.1’s holon substrate is the target of A.14’s edge discipline (`ComponentOf`, `ConstituentOf`, `PortionOf`, `PhaseOf`); only mereological subtypes build holarchies.

* **Interacts with the Γ‑family (B‑cluster):**

  * **B.1 Universal Algebra of Aggregation** — Γ is defined **on holons** and respects CC‑A1.\*; Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time carry order and temporal composition, Γ\_work handles resource ledgers.
  * **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)** — uses A.1’s boundary and Inside/Outside rules to decide when aggregation yields a **new** whole with novel properties.
  * **B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus** — evidence attaches to carriers (SCR/RSCR) of epistemes; assurance levels depend on A.1/A.10 alignment.
  * **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop** — operationalises the **design↔run** seam at holon boundaries; observation itself is an external transformation across a boundary.

* **Specialised by architheories:** `U.System` (Sys‑CAL) and `U.Episteme` (KD‑CAL) are archetypal sub‑holons that supply domain‑specific invariants while inheriting A.1’s boundary and aggregation duties. 

*Without the holon, parts drift; without the role, purpose evaporates.* (Carry this epigraph with A.1 to cue the A.2 hand‑off.)

## A.7 Strict Distinction

### A.7:1 - Intent

Provide a **single, didactically clear lattice of distinctions** that keeps models free from category errors. This pattern is the guard‑rail that prevents four recurrent confusions:

1. **Role vs Function** (mask vs behaviour),
2. **MethodDescription vs Method vs Work** (description vs capability vs occurrence),
3. **Holon vs System vs Episteme** (what can act and what cannot),
4. **Episteme vs Carrier** (knowledge vs its material signs).

It harmonizes A.12 (External Transformer), A.13 (Agential Role & Agency Spectrum), A.14 (Advanced Mereology), and A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment).

### A.7:2 - Problem frame

* **Holons (A.1) and systems.** All holons are part/whole units; **only systems** can enact behaviour.
* **Externalization (A.12).** Every change is performed by a **system bearing TransformerRole** across a boundary; there is no “self‑magic”.
* **Quartet backbone (A.3, A.15).** We separate **MethodDescription** (description), **Method** (**capability under a role**), and **Work** (run‑time occurrence), with the **system bearing TransformerRole** as the acting side.
* **Evidence (A.10).** Knowledge claims are anchored via **Symbol‑Carrier Register (SCR)**; epistemes never “act”, they are **used** by systems that act on their **carriers**.

Manager’s reading: if a sentence could be read as “the document decided” or “the process executed itself”, it violates A.7.

### A.7:3 - Problem

When documents blur the above lines, three classes of defects appear:

1. **Category collapse.** People write “function/role/process” interchangeably; teams then disagree whether they are changing a plan, a capability, or reporting an actual occurrence.
2. **Agency misplacement.** Epistemes (documents, models) are treated as doers; collectives as raw sets; or a “holon” is used where **only a system** makes sense.
3. **Audit failures.** A MethodDescription is cited as if it were evidence; or Work has no anchors (no carriers, no time span), making trust impossible (B.3).

### A.7:4 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| **Didactic brevity vs conceptual precision** | Teams want short words (“process”, “function”) ↔ the framework must keep five distinct layers apart. |
| **Universality vs domain idioms** | We support engineering idioms (procedure, SOP, algorithm, workflow) ↔ internally we must map them unambiguously. |
| **Parsimony vs completeness** | Minimal concept set ↔ enough distinctions to avoid the classic traps (role/function; plan/capability/occurrence; episteme/carrier). |

### A.7:5 - Solution — The **Clarity Lattice** (normative distinctions & safe vocabulary)

#### A.7:5.1 - **Terminology (normative): orthogonal characteristics**
• **senseFamily** — the categorical characteristic, used by F.7/F.8/F.9: {Role | Status | Measurement | Type‑structure | Method | Execution}. Rows must be **sense‑uniform**. 
• **ReferencePlane** — the referent mode per CHR: {world/external | conceptual | epistemic}. 
• **I/D/S layer** — the Intension/Description/Specification layer (E.10.D2). Not an I/D/S “plane” or "stance", and not a bare "layer".
• **DesignRunTag** — the design vs run DesignRunTag. Not a temporal “plane” or "layer", and not a bare "stance".
• **PublicationSurface** — the *didactic projection* of a Description/Specification into a **bundle of views** (ISO 42010 sense). **Surfaces are not the thing described**. Under L‑SURF, Core allows only **PublicationSurface** and **InteropSurface** tokens; faces SHALL be named **…View / …Card / …Lane** rather than inventing new `…Surface` kinds. The canonical didactic set for architectural patterns in FPF is:
  {**PlainView** (explanatory prose), **TechCard** (typed cards/IDs), **NormsCard** (TechCard profile for checklists/SHALL‑clauses), **AssuranceLane** (evidence bindings/lanes)}. *Surfaces are orthogonal to I/D/S and to design/run.*
• **Typed describing/formalising morphisms (I→D, D→S)** — total morphisms that *project* along I/D/S (they are **not** mechanisms):
  `Describe_ID : I → D` (describe an intensional object into the world of descriptions; historical alias `Publ_ID`) and
  `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS : D → S` (refine a description into a specification). Composition `Describe_IS := Specify_DS ∘ Describe_ID : I → S` is allowed but both stages MUST remain visible and auditable.
  **Laws (normative):** (ID‑1) *Non‑extensibility of content*; (ID‑2) *Identity & meaning‑preserving composition*; (DS‑1) *Monotonic refinement* under ≤₍ref₎; (DS‑2) *Pin editions & measurable anchors* per **MM‑CHR** (C.16) via **CHR‑Pins**; (DS‑3) *No retro‑effects*.

A.7 establishes the following **pairs and triplets**. Use their **names** and **scope** exactly as below.

#### A.7:5.2 - Role vs Function (behaviour)

* **Role (role‑object, mask).** A contextual **position** a holon can bear (A.2, A.15). A role is **not behaviour**; it is the **mask** under which behaviour may be enacted. Example: **Cooling‑CirculatorRole** in a thermal loop.
* **Function = behaviour = Method under a role.** What a **system** actually does **when bearing a role**. In Transformer context, this behaviour is the **Method** (design‑time capability) that can be executed as **Work** (run‑time).

  * Safe rewrite for earlier “Holonic Duality (Substance ⧧ Function)”: **Holonic Duality (Substance ⧧ Role).** A `U.System` keeps its identity (substance) while **switching roles**; each role may entail a **Method** (behaviour) and its possible **Work** (occurrence).

**Normative guard:** Use “**Role**” for the mask; use “**Method/Work**” for behaviour/occurrence. Do **not** call the role itself a function.

#### A.7:5.3 - MethodDescription vs Method vs Work (design vs capability vs occurrence)

* **MethodDescription** — the **description** (algorithm / SOP / recipe / script) at design‑time. Anchored via **SCR** (A.10).
* **Method** — the **order‑sensitive capability** the **system bearing TransformerRole** can enact, composed with **Γ\_method** (B.1.5). A Method is a **timeless semantic capability**; **concrete values** are **bound at `U.Work` creation**. Outside executions we **refer to it via MethodDescription** (see A.3.1 CC‑A3.1‑5/‑9; A.15 §2.2, §4.1). 
* **Work** — the **dated run‑time occurrence** (what actually happened), with resource spend (Γ\_work) and temporal coverage (Γ\_time).

**Normative guard:** Never use MethodDescription as evidence of Work; never present Method as if it had happened.

#### A.7:5.4 - Holon vs System vs Episteme (who can act)

* **System** — the only holon kind that can **bear behavioural roles** and enact **Method/Work**.
* **Episteme** — **cannot act**; it is **changed via its carriers** by a system. Epistemes **may bear non‑behavioural roles** (e.g., **ReferenceRole**, **ConstraintSourceRole**).
* **Holon** — umbrella term; **do not** use it where only **system** is meaningful (e.g., “holon bearing TransformerRole” is **invalid**; write “**system bearing TransformerRole**”).

**Normative guard:** Behavioural roles (including TransformerRole) have **domain = system**. Epistemes may bear purely **classificatory** roles only.

#### A.7:5.5 - Episteme vs Symbol Carrier (SCR/RSCR)

* **Episteme** — the knowledge content (claim, model, requirement set).
* **Symbol Carrier** — the physical/digital sign that carries the episteme (file, volume, dataset item), tracked in **SCR**; remote sets in **RSCR**.
* **Use:** Evidence, provenance, and reproducibility address **carriers**; arguments and validity address **epistemes**.

**Normative guard:** When you say “we updated the spec”, detail **which carriers** changed (A.10).

#### A.7:5.6 - Collective vs Set, and MemberOf vs Component/Constituent/Portion/Phase (A.14)

* **Set / Collection (MemberOf)** — **mathematical or catalog** grouping; **no joint behaviour** implied.
* **Collective System** — a **system** with boundary and coordination Method (e.g., a team).
* **Use relations correctly:**

  * **ComponentOf** — mechanical/structural part in systems.
  * **ConstituentOf** — logical/content part in epistemes.
  * **PortionOf** — quantitative portion with conserved extensives.
  * **PhaseOf** — temporal part/state across a continuous identity.
  * **RoleBearerOf** — a **system** is the **bearer** of a **Role**.

**Normative guard:** If the grouping is expected to **act**, model a **collective system** (not a set) and provide its role and Method/Work.

#### A.7:5.7 - Operator alignment (names you MUST use)

* **Γ\_sys** — composition of **system** properties (physical/systemic).
* **Γ\_method** — composition of **Method** (order, branching).
* **Γ\_time** — composition of **Work** histories and temporal parts.
* **Γ\_work** — composition of **resource spend** and yields tied to Work. Do not track costs with Γ\_method; costs (resources/yield) belong to Γ\_work.

**Normative guard:** Avoid generic “process” for these operators. Reserve “process” for domain idioms; map internally to **Method** (design) and **Work** (run).

#### A.7:5.8 - I/D/S vs PublicationSurface (orthogonal, normative)
* **I/D/S governs the model.** What the thing *is* vs how it is *described/tested* lives in I/D/S (E.10.D2).
* **PublicationSurface governs the didactic projection.** How D/S are **presented** lives on **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface** only; concrete faces SHALL be **PlainView / TechCard / InteropCard / AssuranceLane**. Cards/views are **conceptual views over D/S**, not the intensional object **and not symbol carriers**; physical/digital **carriers** stay in **SCR/RSCR** (A.10).
* **Surface field pins.** When D/S are shown on **TechCard**, pin the minimal **CHR‑Pins** = {**UnitType**, **ScaleKind**, **ReferencePlane**, **EditionId**}. 
* **Bridge routing.** Cross‑Context or cross‑plane reuse **MUST** cite **Bridge id + CL**; **Φ(CL)**/**Φ_plane** penalties route to **R (trust)** only; **F/G invariant**. 

#### A.7:5.9 - Typed describing/formalising morphisms (I→D→S, normative)

**What `Describe_ID` / `Specify_DS` mean in A.7.** For any intensional object `X ∈ I`, *describing X* is the morphism application `Describe_ID(X) : D` (historical alias `Publ_ID(X)` in earlier drafts); *formalising that description* is `Specify_DS(Describe_ID(X)) : S` (alias `Formalize_DS`). The collapsed arrow `Describe_IS(X)` MAY be referenced, but **implementations SHALL expose and audit both steps**.

**Invariants (restate of the A.6.2/A.6.3 laws, audit‑oriented):**
1. **Non‑extensibility (ID‑1).** `Describe_ID` MUST NOT introduce new epistemic commitments. If a claim `c` is absent in `X`, it is absent in `Describe_ID(X)`; any added structure is representational only (formatting, indexing, cross‑references).
2. **Identity & meaning preservation (ID‑2).** If `f : X → Y` is a meaning‑preserving map in I, then `Describe_ID(f)` is defined and preserves identity, and where meaningful composition exists, `Describe_ID(f ∘ g) = Describe_ID(f) ∘ Describe_ID(g)`.
3. **Monotonic refinement (DS‑1).** If `D₁ ≤₍ref₎ D₂`, then `Specify_DS(D₁) ≤₍ref₎ Specify_DS(D₂)` (equivalently `Formalize_DS(D₁) ≤₍ref₎ Formalize_DS(D₂)`). Also `D ≤₍ref₎ Specify_DS(D)` holds when S merely adds testable structure.
4. **Pinning of editions & anchors (DS‑2).** `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS` MUST pin: **edition id**, **unit/scale types**, **ReferencePlane**, and **measurable anchors** (CG‑Spec/CHR). Pins are visible on **TechCard/NormsCard** faces and recorded in **SCR**; edition governance follows **U.EditionSeries**.
5. **No retro‑effects (DS‑3).** Applying `Specify_DS` yields a *new* `S` and *new* carriers (new SCR ids); earlier carriers remain valid in their scope; **no retro‑mutation** of prior I/D carriers.
6. **Separation from Γ.** `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` (`Publ_ID`/`Formalize_DS` in legacy text) do **not** compose with **Γ\_method**, **Γ\_time**, or **Γ\_work**; I/D/S describing/formalising is *not execution* and accrues no resource/time semantics.
7. **Ontology preservation.** Describing any object (Calculus/Signature/Mechanism/…) via `Describe_ID` does **not** change its ontology; it yields a D/S projection by A.7 rules. *Describing/formalising is not a subtype of mechanism*; publishing to surfaces is handled separately in E.17 (MVPK).

### A.7:6 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show; System / Episteme)

#### A.7:6.1 - System and Episteme example
**System archetype — “Digital‑twin vs asset”.**  
*Claim:* *The twin (episteme) does not “act”; the **system** bearing TransformerRole enacts Work on the asset; evidence binds to carriers.*  
*Show:* A maintenance **MethodDescription** (tech card) lives at design‑time; a **Work** record (assurance face) lists Γ_time, Γ_work, PathId and **carrier** ids for telemetry. The twin’s update is **Work on the carrier**, not the asset; CL^plane penalties are disclosed when twin–asset crossings are analysed.

**Episteme archetype — “Peer‑review vs manuscript”.**  
*Claim:* *A review is Work by a **system** (the reviewer) **on carriers** of an episteme (the manuscript).*  
*Show:* The **MethodDescription** is the review SOP; the **Work** cites carrier ids (file/edition) and the *describedEntity* episteme; arguments/rebuttals live on epistemes; acceptance gating lives in CAL, not in CHR cards.

#### A.7:6.2 - Didactic examples

**Example 1 — Pump in a cooling loop**

* **Substance (system):** Centrifugal pump P‑12.
* **Role:** **Cooling‑CirculatorRole**.
* **MethodDescription:** “Loop Circulation v3” (**TechCard**, anchored in SCR).
* **Method:** ordered capability: start → ramp → hold → stop (Γ\_method).
* **Work:** run on 2025‑08‑09 10:00–10:45; energy ledger via Γ\_work; log via Γ\_time.
* **Safe phrasing:** *“The **system** playing **Cooling‑CirculatorRole** (via the P‑12 control unit as **Transformer**) executed the **Method** described by **MethodDescription**, producing **Work** …”*
* **What not to write:** “The pump’s function is the role” (role ≠ behaviour).

**Example 2 — Standard document cited in a design**

* **Episteme:** “Safety Standard S‑174”.
* **Carriers:** PDF (SCR id: scr://std/S‑174/2025‑07), printed volume (scr://print/S‑174/2e).
* **Role:** **ReferenceRole** in the valve selection activity.
* **System bearing TransformerRole:** design team’s selection service.
* **MethodDescription:** “Valve Selection SOP v5”.
* **Method/Work:** capability and dated selection session that **used** the standard; the episteme did **not** act.

**Example 3 — Set vs team**

* **Set (MemberOf):** {Alice, Bob, 3.14} — a collection; **no behaviour** implied.
* **Collective system (team):** boundary, coordination **Method**, supervision **Work**; can bear **AgentialRole** (A.13).
* **Safe phrasing:** *“Team T plays **Cooling‑MaintenanceRole** and executed Work W…”*

### A.7:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID | Requirement | Practical test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC‑A7.1 (Role/Behaviour split)** | A **Role** must be modelled as a contextual **mask** borne by a holon; **behaviour** must be expressed as **Method** (design‑time capability) and **Work** (run‑time occurrence). | In any sentence, if “role” is used as if it *does* something, rewrite: the **system bearing TransformerRole** does it **by Method/Work**. |
| **CC‑A7.2 (Transformer domain)** | **TransformerRole SHALL be borne only by a system.** | Type‑check: bearer ∈ `U.System`. “holon bearing TransformerRole” is invalid. |
| **CC‑A7.3 (Episteme non‑agency)** | An **episteme SHALL NOT** be described as acting. All changes to epistemes must be routed to their **symbol carriers** (A.10) by a **system bearing TransformerRole**. | Text contains the acting system + carriers (SCR ids). |
| **CC‑A7.4 (MethodDescription ≠ Method ≠ Work)** | **MethodDescription** (description), **Method** (capability), and **Work** (occurrence) **SHALL** be kept distinct in wording and modelling. | Ask: is there a design artefact? a capability? a dated occurrence? Each must be named separately. |
| **CC‑A7.5 (Operator fit)** | Use **Γ\_method** only for composing **Method**; **Γ\_time** only for **Work** histories; **Γ\_work** only for resource spend/yields; **Γ\_sys** for systemic properties of systems. | No sentence should use a single generic “process operator” for all three. |
| **CC‑A7.6 (SCR anchoring)** | Any knowledge claim that references documents/data **SHALL** anchor **carriers** via **SCR/RSCR** on first mention in the subsection. | First mention expands as “Symbol‑Carrier Register (SCR)”; references list carrier ids. |
| **CC‑A7.7 (Collective vs set)** | If a grouping is expected to **act**, it **MUST** be modelled as a **collective system** (boundary + coordination Method + Work), not as a **MemberOf** set. | Presence of boundary, Method, Work for the group. |
| **CC‑A7.8 (Diagram legend)** | When domain idioms use **“process”**, diagrams/text **MUST** map them to FPF terms on first occurrence: *process (domain) ≡ Method (design‑time) / Work (run‑time).* | Legend or parenthetical present at first use. |
| **CC‑A7.9 (Substance ⧧ Role wording)** | The safe formula is **“System (substance) plays Role; under that Role it has Method; its execution is Work.”** | Sentences follow this order; “function” used only as synonym for **behaviour**, never for the **role**. |
| **CC‑A7.10 (Quartet clarity)** | Any “triad” picture **MAY** be used only as a **design‑time stand‑in** (Transformer + MethodDescription + Method) and **MUST** be accompanied by an explicit **Work** lane elsewhere in the same section. “quartet of quartets” headings **SHALL** be avoided; use **“Quartet backbone”** instead. | Diagram has a visible **Work** lane/timeline or separate box within the same section.
| **CC‑A7.11 (Terminology hygiene)** | Ban **“actor”** in core text. Use **“system bearing TransformerRole”**; bind local shorthand **“Transformer”** only per A.12 rules. | Plain text scan: no “actor”; shorthand is locally bound. |
| **CC‑A7.12 (Role domain guards)** | Behavioural roles’ domain = **system**. Epistemes may bear **non‑behavioural** roles (e.g., ReferenceRole, ConstraintSourceRole) only. | Role declarations name their domain. |
| **CC‑A7.13 (I→D→S visibility)** | I/D/S morphisms MUST be **explicit**; do not conflate them with MVPK or TGA steps. If a flow shows only surfaces, the underlying `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` steps MUST be recoverable. | Both steps are visible in text/diagrams; audit shows two distinct operations. |
| **CC‑A7.14 (Describe_ID / Specify_DS laws)** | Any implementation of `Describe_ID` MUST enforce **ID‑1/ID‑2**; `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS` MUST enforce **DS‑1/‑2/‑3**. Violating systems are considered out‑of‑model. | Diff check between I and D shows no new claims; mapping table shows preserved composition. |
| **CC‑A7.15 (Formalize_DS laws)** | `Formalize_DS` obeys **DS‑1/DS‑2/DS‑3**: monotonic refinement; pins edition/unit/scale/ReferencePlane/anchors; produces new **S** + **SCR** carriers without retro‑mutation. | Presence of **CHR‑Pins** and pinned anchors; new SCR ids; no edits to prior carriers. |
| **CC‑A7.16 (Γ‑separation)** | Both I/D/S describing/formalising morphisms (`Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS`) and publication‑to‑surface morphisms (MVPK) SHALL NOT carry cost/time semantics; **Γ\_method**, Γ\_time and Γ\_work belong to **Method/Work/System**, not to description/specification or publication. Any aggregate on a card must cite the Γ operator and policy. | No ledger/time fields attached to `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` or MVPK publication steps; any “publication cost” is Work in a separate publication service. |
| **CC‑A7.17 (**Surface tokens only)** | Only **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface** tokens are allowed; faces are **…View/…Card/…Lane**. Use only `PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane` (and their tech aliases) unless a DRR extends the set. New `…Surface` kinds require a DRR and L‑SURF revision. | Token scan shows no ad‑hoc `…Surface` kinds. |
| **CC‑A7.18 (Bridge+CL on crossings)** | Any cross‑Context or cross‑plane content on a face **MUST** cite **Bridge id + CL** and **Φ policy‑ids**; penalties route to **R** only. | Presence of Bridge ids and **Φ(CL)**/**Φ_plane** on TechCard/AssuranceLane. |
| **CC‑A7.19 (UTS anchoring)** | Public names shown on faces **SHALL** point to **UTS rows** with twin labels (Tech/Plain), edition pins, and SCR carrier ids. | Face carries UTS row ids + edition pins. |

### A.7:8 - Canonical rewrites (didactic library)

| Instead of (ambiguous) | Write (canonical) | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “The process enforced the rule.” | “The **system bearing TransformerRole** enforced the rule by executing the **Method**; the **Work** is anchored to carriers ⟨ids⟩.” | Processes don’t act; systems do. Evidence via Work + SCR. |
| “The specification decided to tighten limits.” | “The **design‑control service (system bearing TransformerRole)** updated the **carriers** of the spec (SCR ids), producing **Work** at ⟨time⟩.” | Epistemes are changed via carriers by systems. |
| “Our role is pump; the role circulates coolant.” | “The **system** plays **Cooling‑CirculatorRole**; under this role its **Method** circulates coolant; **Work** was executed ⟨when⟩.” | Role = mask; behaviour = Method/Work. |
| “We followed the blueprint, so it’s done.” | “We have a **MethodDescription** and a **Method**; completion is evidenced by **Work** with ⟨timestamps, outcomes⟩.” | Description/capability ≠ occurrence. |
| “Team = set of members; it performed repair.” | “The **team** is a **collective system** (boundary + coordination **Method**); it executed **Work** ⟨…⟩.” | Acting groups must be systems, not sets. |
| “Process cost is tracked by Γ\_method.” | “**Work** cost is tracked by **Γ\_work**; **Γ\_method** composes the **Method** (order/branching).” | Operator alignment. |
| “Holon bearing TransformerRole.” | “**System bearing TransformerRole**.” | Only systems can bear behavioural roles. |
| “Publication is a special mechanism.” | “Publication = **typed projection** from existing Descriptions/Specifications onto **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface** (MVPK); **describing/formalising** are `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS`, and any execution around them is separate **Work** by a **system** on **carriers**.” | Publication is not behaviour; it is a D/S→Surface projection in the model. |

### A.7:9 - Anti‑patterns (with fixes)

1. **Role‑as‑behaviour** — calling the **role** “the function”.
   **Fix:** Name the **role** + **Method/Work** pair explicitly.

2. **Episteme‑as‑system** — “the model routed traffic”.
   **Fix:** Name the **system** (or Transformer as a system bearing AgentialRole) that used the model; list **carriers** touched.

3. **Triad everywhere** — omitting **Work** entirely.
   **Fix:** Add the Work lane: timestamps, outcomes, Γ\_time coverage.

4. **Operator blur** — using one “process operator” for everything.
   **Fix:** Choose among **Γ\_method**, **Γ\_time**, **Γ\_work**, **Γ\_sys**.

5. **Set‑as‑collective** — a MemberOf set “decides”.
   **Fix:** Model a **collective system** with coordination Method.

6. **Unanchored evidence** — citing ideas without carriers.
   **Fix:** Add **SCR/RSCR** ids; tie claims to carriers.

7. **Holon/system drift** — “holon maintains temperature”.
   **Fix:** Say **system**; reserve “holon” for neutral mereology.

8. **Function/role swap in tables** — columns labelled “Function” but entries are roles.
   **Fix:** Rename column to **Role**; add a separate **Behaviour (Method/Work)** column.

9. **Process‑word leakage** — domain “process” used as FPF operator.
   **Fix:** Add parenthetical mapping at first use (Method/Work).

10. **Carrier/episteme swap** — “we versioned the model” meaning a file was renamed.
      **Fix:** State whether the **episteme content** changed; if only a carrier was renamed, say so.

11. **Publication‑as‑mechanism** — modelling “publication” as if it were a Method/Mechanism.
      **Fix:** Separate **describing/formalising** (`Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS`) from **publication** (MVPK D/S→Surface). If there is operational toil (build, render, upload), model it as **Work** by a **system** on **carriers**; do not change the ontology of the described object or the D/S episteme being surfaced.

### A.7:10 - Consequences

| Benefit | Why it matters | Trade‑off / Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Category safety at scale** | Prevents silent logic bugs across holarchies. | Slight verbosity → use local shorthand per A.12. |
| **Trustworthy evidence** | Work + SCR anchoring makes claims auditable. | Requires discipline → provide checklists. |
| **Operator determinism** | Correct Γ‑flavour selection preserves invariants. | A bit more modelling → reusable templates. |
| **On‑ramp for managers** | Canonical rewrites give immediate phrasing fixes. | Team training → this pattern is the training page. |

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|---|---|
| **Category‑error firewall.** Clear separation of System/Episteme; I/D/S vs Surface orthogonality removes recurring modeling defects. | Authors must tag surfaces explicitly; mitigated by a minimal **SurfacePack** template in E.8. |
| **Audit and pedagogy align.** SCR/RSCR point to carriers; Normative face houses checklists; Plain face teaches; Tech face types. | Slight increase in pattern length; offset by predictable navigation and machine‑checkable CC. |
| **Cross-Context safety.** Bridge+CL discipline is now visible even on surfaces. | Authors must cite CL policy-ids; tooling can assist (GateCrossing visibility harness), but text remains notation-independent. |

### A.7:11 - SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

* **Digital Twins (ISO 23247, 2021→):** separates the asset (system) from its **digital representation** (episteme) and prescribes governance of twins without attributing *agency* to the twin itself — matching A.7’s “episteme ≠ actor” and carrier discipline. **Adopt.** 
* **Observability (OpenTelemetry, 2019→2025):** codifies **semantic conventions** as a *publication layer* over traces/metrics/logs; semantics live in descriptions, not exporters — echoing our **PublicationSurface** orthogonality. **Adapt** (terminology). 
* **Active Inference (2017→2024):** separates a **generative model** (episteme) from **actions** by the agent (system), with explicit perception–action cycles — mirroring A.7’s “who can act” and stance separation. **Adopt** 
* **Constructor Theory (2016→):** frames knowledge and work as **possible transformations** enacted by constructors (systems), not by informational states — reinforcing “episteme ≠ actor”. **Adopt** 
* **Quality‑Diversity (MAP‑Elites family, 2015→2024):** archives are **sets on typed spaces** (descriptions) whose **occurrences** are runs; selection returns **sets** under lawful orders — consonant with A.7 and A.15’s set‑returning discipline. **Adopt/Adapt**. 
* **Refinement‑typed specs (2016→):** modern stacks (e.g., Liquid Haskell, Dafny’s post‑2017 refinements, Rust’s `uom` type‑level units) treat formalization as **monotonic refinement with pinned units/scales** — echoing **Formalize_DS** and **Surface field pins**. **Adapt** (terminology; pinning discipline).

### A.7:12 - Rationale (informal)

* **Engineering cognition:** Large programmes fail less from equations than from category slips (“process vs procedure vs execution”). A.7 eliminates these slips by a small, repeatable grammar.
* **Compatible with ISO/BORO practice:** Distinguishing artefacts (specs), capabilities (procedures), and occurrences (operations) mirrors established systems‑engineering discipline while keeping FPF’s holonic rigor.
* **Didactic primacy:** Managers can approve sentences by spotting five tokens: **system bearing TransformerRole** / **Role** / **Method** / **Work** / **SCR**.
* **Why bring “PublicationSurface” into A.7?** Strict Distinction already guards **what a thing is (I)** from **how we describe/specify it (D/S)**. In practice, **misreadings happen at the publication layer**: cards and tables are mistaken for objects; governance words leak where physics/logic should stand. By making **PublicationSurface** *explicit and orthogonal*, A.7 closes that gap without entangling semantics with any tool or notation. This preserves **C‑1 universality** and **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**, while giving E.8 a crisp home for multi‑face presentation rules.

### A.7:13 - Relations

 **Builds on:** A.1 (Holon), A.2 (Roles), A.3 (Transformer Quartet), A.10 (Evidence & SCR), A.12 (External Transformer), A.14 (Advanced Mereology), A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment).  
* **Constrains:** A.13 (Agency sits on systems only; epistemes non‑behavioural), Part B operators (**Γ_method**/**Γ_time**/**Γ_work**/**Γ_sys**) and their choice points; **publication is not a Γ‑operator**.  
* **Extends:** E.8 (Authoring conventions), E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE incl. **L‑SURF**), **Part F/G (UTS & CG‑Spec/CHR pinning)**, B.3 (Assurance routing), C‑cluster (selection/archives) — by enforcing I/D/S vs Surface orthogonality, System/Episteme separation, and typed I→D→S describing/formalising discipline (**publication = D/S→Surface in E.17**).  
* **Coordinates with:** **E.18 (E.TGA - GateCrossing / OperationalGate(profile))** for crossing visibility & publication gating, **A.21/A.27** for check/pinning discipline, **E.10** for lexical SD checks, and **Part F (Bridges/CL)** for explicit cross-Context identity — without embedding any notation dependence.
  
### A.7:14 - Manager’s one‑page review (copy‑paste)

**Approval sentence template**

> “The **system bearing TransformerRole** ⟨name⟩ plays ⟨Role⟩; it has **Method** ⟨M⟩ (from **MethodDescription** ⟨S⟩) and executed **Work** ⟨W⟩ on ⟨time⟩, anchored to ⟨SCR ids⟩; resources accounted via **Γ\_work**.”

**Five binary checks**

1. **Actor ban:** No “actor” token; canonical phrasing present.
2. **Clear trio:** MethodDescription / Method / Work are all named (as applicable) and not conflated.
3. **Right Γ:** Γ\_method for capability; Γ\_time for occurrence; Γ\_work for resources; Γ\_sys for system properties.
4. **Episteme handled:** Epistemes do not act; carriers listed (SCR).
5. **Group clarity:** Acting group is a **collective system**, not a MemberOf set.

**Diagram legend stub**

* “process (domain)” ⇒ Method (design‑time) / Work (run‑time).
* Role column lists masks (e.g., Cooling‑CirculatorRole).
* Behaviour column shows Method/Work, not the role itself.
